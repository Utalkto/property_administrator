Orinoco: Perfect, thank you - 2022-06-30 21:02:16+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-06-30 21:38:48+00:00 
other_person: Sent you the quote - 2022-06-30 21:38:48+00:00 
Orinoco: Great, thanks Antonio. I'll review and let you know. Does this include any materials? - 2022-06-30 21:59:08+00:00 
other_person: No, just labour - 2022-06-30 22:01:43+00:00 
other_person: Do you want me to send you a material list so you know what what you will need to buy? - 2022-06-30 22:05:44+00:00 
Orinoco: Sure, if you don't mind, that would be helpful - 2022-06-30 22:09:15+00:00

other_person: I can supply the drywall screws, tape and mud - 2022-06-30 23:29:26+00:00 
other_person: The tiles, tub , vanity, toilet and vinyl flooring you will have to go see what you like  - 2022-06-30 23:30:57+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect, thanks Antonio. Have a good evening! - 2022-07-01 02:31:20+00:00 
other_person: Thanks you too - 2022-07-01 02:34:37+00:00 
Orinoco: Hi Antonio, hope you had a good weekend. 

I have a couple questions about the material list. 

- Is the tile wall glue the same as a bag of grout?
- Not sure what you mean by tile leveling kit 
- Should the drywall should be the green mold-resistant type?

Thanks! - 2022-07-04 14:36:40+00:00 
other_person: Wall tile adhesive its white and comes in a bucket.
You will need to buy grout too whatever color you like.
Yes get the blue drywall that's mold resistant
 - 2022-07-04 14:53:56+00:00 
other_person: That's the tile leveling kit - 2022-07-04 14:55:31+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-04 14:56:36+00:00 
other_person: That's what the wall glue looks like - 2022-07-04 14:56:50+00:00 
Orinoco: Great, thanks!

Are you able to purchase the tile levelling kit if it's something you'll use again?

Also, I'm not sure how to order baseboard and paint online. Is this something you'd be able to purchase yourself if I let you know style/colour? - 2022-07-04 15:06:39+00:00 
Orinoco: For the tile edge, is one of these enough?

https://www.homedepot.ca/product/prova-ceramic-aluminum-tile-edge-satin-clear-5-16-inch-8mm-/1000152494 - 2022-07-04 15:07:44+00:00 
other_person: If the tile is going all the way up to the ceiling in the bathtub you will need two of those - 2022-07-04 15:08:54+00:00 
other_person: Yes we can pick up the paint as long as we know what color - 2022-07-04 15:09:15+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok thanks. 

Is 1 qt of tile adhesive enough? Or do you need 1 gallon? - 2022-07-04 15:13:30+00:00 
other_person: I would go with 1 gallon because we always back butter the tile  - 2022-07-04 15:16:09+00:00 
Orinoco: Sounds good. 

What are your thoughts on using PVC baseboard in the bathroom? To try to avoid moisture damage/swelling with MDF - 2022-07-04 15:19:57+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good to me - 2022-07-04 15:26:29+00:00 
Orinoco: Do you recall what style of light fixture is currently above the vanity? Not sure if you took any photos - 2022-07-04 16:00:59+00:00 
Orinoco:  - 2022-07-04 16:20:29+00:00 
Orinoco: I believe it's something like this. - 2022-07-04 16:20:35+00:00 
Orinoco: Since the bathroom will be painted anyway, can we install something like this instead (just wondering about the size/shape of the mount) - 2022-07-04 16:21:07+00:00 
Orinoco:  - 2022-07-04 16:21:17+00:00 
other_person: Yes I'm pretty sure it had 4 light bulbs - 2022-07-04 16:22:01+00:00 
other_person: It will be a lot cheaper - 2022-07-04 16:25:20+00:00 
other_person: Instead of the wall adhesive bucket get two bags of this mortar mix - 2022-07-04 16:25:29+00:00 
Orinoco: Where do you get the mortar mix? I can't seem to find it in stock anywhere. It also seems quite a bit more expensive than the bucket of tile adhesive - 2022-07-04 17:01:17+00:00 
other_person: That bag was only 14.50 at lowes - 2022-07-04 17:03:04+00:00 
Orinoco: I see it now, thanks üëç - 2022-07-04 17:08:34+00:00 
Orinoco: Doesn't look like they have that brand at Home Depot. Is this one a similar product? I can order from Lowe's no problem, just wanted to avoid you needing to go to two spots if possible. Whatever you prefer.

other_person: As long as it says for floors and walls - 2022-07-04 17:19:44+00:00 
Orinoco: There are a few different options and I'm not sure of the differences. I can't seem to find the exact same product at Lowe's either.

Would you be able to pick up the mortar mix yourself and add to the invoice, like the paint? Just want to make sure I don't buy the wrong product. - 2022-07-04 17:54:19+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good  - 2022-07-04 17:54:54+00:00 
Orinoco: Thank you. 

Is a 10lb bag of grout sufficient?

https://www.homedepot.ca/product/custom-building-products--386-oyster-gray-polyblend-non-sanded-grout-10lb/1000400070 - 2022-07-04 18:02:39+00:00 
other_person: Yes - 2022-07-04 18:32:01+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect, thanks. When would you be available for pick-up? / when are you looking to start the job?

Is it possible to complete before the 15th? - 2022-07-04 20:52:14+00:00 
other_person: We can start Thursday  - 2022-07-04 20:54:32+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good. Would Thursday be the ideal pick-up day? - 2022-07-04 20:55:15+00:00 
other_person: We can try to pick everything up Wednesday that way we don't lose anytime Thursday - 2022-07-04 21:11:17+00:00 
Orinoco: Sounds good. I'll try for Wednesday pick up and let you know. And you expect it will take ~4 days? Thursday to Sunday? - 2022-07-04 21:14:26+00:00 
other_person: Finish Monday we won't work Sunday - 2022-07-04 21:39:39+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok no problem. To schedule pick-up, so you mind sending me your email address and a picture of your photo ID? - 2022-07-04 22:02:36+00:00 
other_person: What's your email? I'll send it later today - 2022-07-04 22:04:27+00:00 
Orinoco: My email is hello@orinocoventures.com

You can just tell me your email address and send a photo of your ID through here if that's easier - 2022-07-04 22:06:09+00:00 
Orinoco: Just so I can place the order - 2022-07-04 22:06:23+00:00 
other_person: C1rca0077@live.com  - 2022-07-04 22:26:37+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-04 22:29:05+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect, thanks! I'll let you know when I place the order. - 2022-07-04 22:33:04+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good  - 2022-07-04 22:39:06+00:00 
Orinoco: Just placed the order. It should be ready for pick up on Wednesday under your name. I assume you will get an email once it's ready for pick-up - 2022-07-05 00:50:06+00:00 
Orinoco: I did not buy the mortar mix, tile leveling kit or paint. 

For paint, please pick up one gallon of eggshell, colour Turkish Tower (it is a light grey-beige colour).

For the leveling kit, is this something that you will be re-using? - 2022-07-05 00:53:55+00:00 
other_person: I have the wedges but the plastic clear pieces will have to be bought because those don't get reused - 2022-07-05 00:55:21+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good, makes sense. It looks like there are a couple different brands/systems, so if you can also pick up the plastic pieces that go with your wedges, that would be great - 2022-07-05 00:56:19+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good  - 2022-07-05 01:00:21+00:00 
Orinoco: Good morning Antonio, I received an email that the order is ready for pick-up at Home Depot. Did you get an email as well? - 2022-07-06 14:52:23+00:00 
other_person: I didn't get am email - 2022-07-06 15:20:24+00:00 
other_person: An  - 2022-07-06 15:20:28+00:00 
Orinoco: Hmm. That's strange. I just forwarded you the email I received. Let me know if you get it - 2022-07-06 15:50:17+00:00 
other_person: No email yet - 2022-07-06 16:34:42+00:00 
Orinoco: Good morning Antonio. We ordered some different tile last night and it looks like it is now ready for pick-up. Did you receive an email? - 2022-07-07 14:18:49+00:00 
other_person: Got the email - 2022-07-07 15:20:47+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect - 2022-07-07 15:32:46+00:00 
other_person: We need a couple shut off valves and some plumbing material still. Are you able to e transfer $125 that would have been for the delivery and dump fee so we can go buy what's needed. All of our money is tied up in other jobs and we are still waiting for payment from them  - 2022-07-07 15:57:03+00:00 
Orinoco: Sure, what is your email? - 2022-07-07 15:57:54+00:00 
other_person: andasol89@hotmail.com  - 2022-07-07 15:59:43+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok, I will have to send it at 11:00 - 2022-07-07 16:00:14+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good, thanks - 2022-07-07 16:00:42+00:00 
Orinoco: Just sent $125 - 2022-07-07 17:10:19+00:00 
other_person: It's in there, thanks again - 2022-07-07 17:24:19+00:00 
Orinoco: Hi Antonio, just wanted to check if you were able to pick up the tile at Home Depot? - 2022-07-08 21:47:40+00:00 
other_person: I will go later today - 2022-07-08 21:48:24+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok perfect, thanks - 2022-07-08 21:48:39+00:00 
other_person: I have the tile. I forgot it was my niece's birthday today so we won't be working today but we will be there tomorrow instead - 2022-07-09 19:25:17+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good. Thanks for letting me know Antonio. - 2022-07-09 19:43:44+00:00 
Orinoco: Hey Antonio. Sorry I missed your call, just tied up right now. Are you able to text your question? - 2022-07-10 16:32:06+00:00 
other_person: Just needed another 150 to get some more material  - 2022-07-10 16:35:25+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good, I can send that over. How are things going? Do you expect to be finished tomorrow? - 2022-07-10 16:38:07+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good, I can send that over. How are things going? Do you expect to be finished tomorrow? - 2022-07-10 16:38:35+00:00 
other_person: It's looking like we should be done tomorrow  - 2022-07-10 16:40:05+00:00 
other_person: Just the drywall was the wrong size it's 5/8s here and we bought half inch  - 2022-07-10 16:41:09+00:00 
other_person: Which is weird because it's usually half inch in the bathroom - 2022-07-10 16:41:39+00:00 
Orinoco: Hmmm. Yes I just looked at the receipt and I paid for 1/2" ultralight mold tough drywall. Can you take it back to Home Depot and get them to give the right product? - 2022-07-10 16:44:25+00:00 
Orinoco: Is the drywall the material you need the $150 for? Or is there other material you're missing? - 2022-07-10 16:44:56+00:00 
other_person: Other material needed - 2022-07-10 16:50:08+00:00 
Orinoco: Just sent $150 - 2022-07-10 16:56:39+00:00 
Orinoco: Will you get the 1/2" drywall from Home Depot? Let me know if they need anything from me - 2022-07-10 16:57:10+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good  - 2022-07-10 16:57:24+00:00 
other_person: We are tiling tomorrow now due to some sets backs so the bathroom won't be ready till Tuesday - 2022-07-11 00:08:09+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok, thanks for letting me know. After tomorrow, how long does everything need to set before using the shower again? - 2022-07-11 14:13:35+00:00 
other_person: It will be ready to use Wednesday morning to let the grout and silicone dry - 2022-07-11 14:14:56+00:00 
Orinoco: üëç - 2022-07-11 14:15:16+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok thanks - 2022-07-11 14:15:33+00:00 
Orinoco: Hey Antonio, The tenant mentioned there are a couple spots of greasy/oily substance on the carpet going up the stairs, as well as on the cement step outside. He said they're about double the size of a toonie. If you make sure those spots as well as any dirt/dust etc from the work are cleaned up once you're finished the job, that would be great, thanks! - 2022-07-11 14:25:24+00:00 
Orinoco: Just curious about the progress. What have you done so far and what's left to go? - 2022-07-11 14:25:59+00:00 
other_person: Everything will be installed today just the grout and silicone for tomorrow  - 2022-07-11 14:30:05+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok awesome. And you were able to grab the gallon of paint? - 2022-07-11 14:30:54+00:00 
other_person: Today I'll pick that up  - 2022-07-11 14:31:27+00:00 
other_person: And we will make sure everything is clean once done - 2022-07-11 14:31:41+00:00 
Orinoco: Sounds good, thanks Antonio. Colour is Turkish Tower, eggshell. It's a light warm grey colour - 2022-07-11 14:33:04+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good  - 2022-07-11 14:33:20+00:00 
Orinoco: Hey Antonio, I saw I got a refund for the bag of grout. Did you end up using a different product? - 2022-07-11 17:50:52+00:00 
other_person: Yes, we returned the grout and silicone because it was the wrong stuff - 2022-07-11 17:52:29+00:00 
other_person: The job will be done in the next hour - 2022-07-12 21:41:58+00:00 
Orinoco: Sounds good Antonio, could you please take a few photos of all the work before you leave? - 2022-07-12 21:43:58+00:00 
other_person: We were gonna send you the photos regardless so you could see - 2022-07-12 21:56:09+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect, thanks so much Antonio. - 2022-07-12 22:05:41+00:00 
other_person: All the material that we bought came up to $410.16  - the $275 you already sent 

The amount left owing is $2685.16 
 - 2022-07-12 22:05:52+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok, thanks Antonio. What material is included in the $410? Could you please send the invoice via email? You can send it to hello@orinocoventures.com - 2022-07-12 22:10:26+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-12 22:16:30+00:00

other_person:  - 2022-07-12 22:16:58+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-12 22:17:11+00:00 
other_person: Plumbing for the bathtub had to be all redone, plumbing for the sink and the hoses, the grout, silicone and drywall had to be bought again that's the refund you saw, all the mortar mix for the tiles, construction glue and paint - 2022-07-12 22:21:16+00:00 
other_person: The toilet ring was way too low so we had to add an extention  - 2022-07-12 22:22:01+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-12 22:22:46+00:00 
other_person: That's the extention - 2022-07-12 22:22:45+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-13 00:46:12+00:00 
other_person: All done - 2022-07-13 00:46:19+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-13 00:46:37+00:00 
other_person: Are you able to send half of the payment today and we can meet you here tomorrow and go over anything that was missed. We just have some stuff to pay today  - 2022-07-13 01:51:51+00:00 
Orinoco: We might not be able to go see the unit ourselves, we'll probably ask someone to go to take a look. But yes, once Lindsay is free she can send half of the amount. Maybe in an hour or so. I'll let you know once she is available. - 2022-07-13 02:02:53+00:00 
other_person: Sounds good thank you - 2022-07-13 02:03:56+00:00 
Orinoco: Just sent you the etransfer for half the amount. We'll try and get someone out to see the work between tomorrow and the next day prior to sending the rest of the payment. Thanks Antonio, have a good night! - 2022-07-13 04:16:59+00:00 
other_person: Thank you. Have a good night  - 2022-07-13 04:17:34+00:00 
Orinoco: Morning Antonio, just wanted to check when the shower can be used so I can let the tenant know.

Also, what is your availability today to meet someone over there to take a look? - 2022-07-13 15:10:52+00:00 
Orinoco: I was also curious about the white caulking in the corners of the tub surround. Is that typical? It just looks a little odd to me, I was expecting grout, or something the same colour as the tile, to be in the corners - 2022-07-13 15:12:18+00:00 
other_person: We are going there soon to install the transition strip  - 2022-07-13 15:13:39+00:00 
other_person: I will take a look when I'm there but caulking always goes in the corner because grout always chips away and causes leaks - 2022-07-13 15:14:33+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok sounds good. Would it be possible to put clear caulking instead of white?

About what time do you think you'll head over? - 2022-07-13 15:15:26+00:00 
other_person: We will be there closer to 10 - 2022-07-13 15:16:32+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok, I'll see if I can send someone over at that time and let you know - 2022-07-13 15:17:14+00:00 
other_person: If we put new caulk he will have to wait till tomorrow to use the shower - 2022-07-13 15:17:18+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok, that would be fine. I think the clear would look better than white. Thanks - 2022-07-13 15:18:25+00:00 
Orinoco: Were you able to install the towel racks and toilet paper holder? - 2022-07-13 15:33:16+00:00 
other_person: Yes  - 2022-07-13 15:35:19+00:00 
other_person: I'll send some pics - 2022-07-13 15:35:29+00:00 
Orinoco: Ok perfect thanks. Someone can meet you over there at 10:00 if that works. Her name is Leah - 2022-07-13 15:36:25+00:00 
Orinoco: Is the shower curtain rod there too? - 2022-07-13 15:42:31+00:00 
other_person: Yes  - 2022-07-13 15:43:35+00:00 
Orinoco: Perfect. Leah will meet you over there at about 10:00 - 2022-07-13 15:44:07+00:00 
other_person:  - 2022-07-13 15:45:19+00:00

other_person:  - 2022-07-13 16:27:33+00:00 
Orinoco: Great, Thanks for the photos. $40 for the transition strip and seal & bond? - 2022-07-13 16:29:20+00:00 
other_person: The hose the old toilet had wasn't long enough we had to buy a longer one - 2022-07-13 16:33:00+00:00
