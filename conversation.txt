Orinoco: Good morning Jaylee, hope you had a good weekend! Just wanted to let you know that it's likely we'll be able to rent your suite for August 1st. We're just in the final stages, but if we are successful, we'll consider giving a portion of the damage deposit back to you, provided everything is properly cleaned and in good condition. 

I've attached a move-out cleaning checklist for your reference. Hope this is helpful.

Since it's likely that a new tenant will be moving in August 1st, it's very important to have everything cleaned before move-out. 

When do you think you think you'll be ready to do the walkthrough? - 2022-07-25 14:24:58+00:00
